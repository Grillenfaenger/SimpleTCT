SimpleTCT
=========

SimpleTCT (Simple Text Comparison Tool) is an open source simplified management environment designed to assist in textual comparison and thematic analysis. Users can display the contents of .rtf files, define themes, highlight passages and add personal notes as required. A document may then be exported containing all of the selected passages, organised thematically, situated alongside the relevant notes. Compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.
